<h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I'm originally from Chicago, IL and moved to Portland, OR in late 2010.</li>
  <li>I have a bachelor's degree in Journalism from Columbia College Chicago, but have worked for the last 8 and a half years as an Event Coordinator and Assisstant General Manager at a world-class microbrewery called <a href="https://breakside.com/">Breakside Brewery.
  </a>
  </li>
  <li> I'm <strong>brand new</strong> to programming, but am eager to continue to learn!</li>
  <li>I decided to leave the <span class="cute">service industry</span> and pursue <span class="lovely">programming</span> for two reasons:</li> 
      <ol>
      <li>I love continuous learning</li>
      <li>I love the challenges of on-the-fly problem solving</li>
      </ol>
  <li>Two things I believe this industry promises to deliver!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Here are a few of the introductory projects I've worked on at Epicodus so far:</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.github.com/elgrons/Goodbye">Goodbye World</a>
</p>
<p>This project utilized html to convey greetings in multiple languages.
</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elgrons/cookierecipe">Cookie Recipe</a>
</p>
<p>Cookie Recipe is a website built using html that allows one to follow instructions to make absolutely delicious cookies.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/elgrons/favorite-things">Favorite Things</a>
</p>
<p>My favorite thing was one of my first websites that uses html and CSS to explore listing some of my favorite things and utilizing different style elements.</p>
</div></div>
<h2>Interests Outside of Epicodus</h2>
<div class="cool-fact">
<p>I love <em>a lot</em> of things in addition to learning how to code!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Including but not limited to:</li>
    <li>Reading science fiction and fantasy novels. One of my favorites to recommend is this high fantasy war epic: 
        <a href="https://steven-erikson.org/malazan-book-of-the-fallen/">The Malazan Book of the Fallen.
        </a> 
    </li>
    <li>Listening to a diverse array of music genres and attending concerts.</li>
    <li>Practicing vinyasa yoga.</li>
