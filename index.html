<p>A little bit about me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm originally from Chicago and moved to Portland, OR in late 2010.</li>
  <li>I have a bachelor's degree in Journalism from Columbia College Chicago, but have worked for the last 8 and a half years as an Event Coordinator and Assisstant General Manager at a world-class microbrewery called <a href="https://breakside.com/">Breakside Brewery.
  </a>
  </li>
  <li> I'm brand new to programming, but am eager to continue to learn!</li>
  <li>I decided to leave the service industry and pursue programming because I love continuous learning and being challenged by on-the-fly problem solving. Two things this industry promises to deliver!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Here are a few of the introductory projects I've worked on at Epicodus so far:</h3>
