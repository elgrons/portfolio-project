#### By _**Eliot Gronstal**_

A simple portfolio site created using HTML and a CSS style sheet designed to give the user a better idea of who I am.

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_

## Description

_My first solo project completed for Epicodus coding school. This is a portfolio site created using the HTML and a CSS style sheet basics I learned for the code review project during Week 1 Intro to Programming Course._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the repository to your desktop from Github.com._
* _Open index.html in your browser._
* _[Or Open the website with this link](https://elgrons.github.io/portfolio-project/)

## Known Bugs

* The float:center; command for img seems to be implemented incorrectly, or is being ignored entirely as a command.
* My .closer CSS style is being applied to my last two photos as well as my final h1 paragraph, but it's meant to only apply it to the text.
